# KAIST CS350 Intro. to Software Engineering, Fall '25

## Announcement
- Nov 17: No class on Nov 19. Instead, I will upload a makeup lecture movie for Nov 19th class by tonight so that you can start Safehome implementation early. 
- Nov 12: Dec 3 (Wed) class will be an offline class, not an online class.
- Nov 3: We do not have a class on Dec 1. Instead of a makeup class, we will extend class hour by 10 min.
- Oct 13: We do not have a midterm exam.  We will have a class on Oct 20 (Mon), but not on Oct 22 (Wed) due to possible conflict w/ exams of other classes.
- Sep 22: Sep 24 (Wed) Zoom class will start from 1:15 pm (not 1:00 pm).
- Sep 10: Slack channel is now open for helping the students to make his/her team through communication.  Please, read [the description on how to use the Slack channel](Team%20Project%20Announcement.pdf).

<!--
- Recommended prerequisite: CS230 System Programming, proficiency in C/C++ programming and Linux utilities
  - Due to the high load of TA, TA will not provide help for basic C/C++/Linux questions.
  - This class can be difficult to follow for exchange students.
   hly recommend to take CS458 after taking CS230 System Programming first -->
  
- Pre-requites:  
  - CS.20300 System Programming, CS.20200 Programming Principles
  - I do not recommend students in non-SoC majors to take this class for its heavy class workload (HW, team project, **a large amount of documentation**, etc.).
  - Also, freshmen students (whose student IDs are 2025xxxx) are not eligible to take this 3rd year class for their insufficient technical communication skills required in team projects. 

- Grading: attendance/class participation/quiz: 20%, HW and project: 30%, mid/final exams: 50%
  - You should turn on your web cam when you participate an online class; class attendance will not be counted otherwise.
  - More than 7 absences of the class will get F grade
  - Late attendance shall be counted as 1/3 absence. If a student is not able to attend a class due to an important event (e.g., attending conf., etc.), he/she should submit 1 week prior notice to the professor.
  - The official language in the class is English. All students should submit all written documents such as homework, project reports, exam, etc. in English; 20% penalty of the max score otherwise.  

- Homework:
  - Homework should be submitted through KLMS  
    - Hint: many questions of exams are from the homeworks.
  - Late HW will be accepted with 10% penalty of the max score in 1 day, 30% penalty of the max score in 3 days. HW will not be accepted after then.
  - All programming HWs you submit must be able to be replayed by executing a single script file on a TA's server account (i.e., submitted HW should not have a dependency on your home directory, environment, etc.).  Also, the replayed execution must demonstrate the same output to the submitted hw. You will get 10% penalty of the max score otherwise.
  - Please, include your student ID in the name of your submiited file(s), so that TAs can easily identify which files are yours.

## Syllabus
This course provides students with basic concepts in software engineering to develop high-quality software economically. The key concepts include software process models, software modeling and design methods, software testing techniques, project management concepts, and software metrics.

Also, students are expected to experience how to apply LLM (large language model) like ChatGpt to improve efficiency of various software development tasks such as documentation, code development, test code generation, and so on.
