<!--
- Recommended prerequisite: CS230 System Programming, proficiency in C/C++ programming and Linux utilities
  - Due to the high load of TA, TA will not provide help for basic C/C++/Linux questions.
  - This class can be difficult to follow for exchange students.
   hly recommend to take CS458 after taking CS230 System Programming first -->
  
- Grading: attendance/class participation/quiz: 20%, HW and project: 30%, mid/final exams: 50%
  - You should turn on your web cam when you participate an online class; class attendance will not be counted otherwise.
  - More than 7 absences of the class will get F grade
  - Late attendance shall be counted as 1/3 absence. If a student is not able to attend a class due to an important event (e.g., attending conf., etc.), he/she should submit 1 week prior notice to the professor.
  - The official language in the class is English. All students should submit all written documents such as homework, project reports, exam, etc. in English; 20% penalty of the max score otherwise.  

- Homework:
  - Homework should be submitted through KLMS  
    - Hint: many questions of exams are from the homeworks.
  - Late HW will be accepted with 10% penalty of the max score in 1 day, 30% penalty of the max score in 3 days. HW will not be accepted after then.
  - All programming HWs you submit must be able to be replayed by executing a single script file on a TA's server account (i.e., submitted HW should not have a dependency on your home directory, environment, etc.).  Also, the replayed execution must demonstrate the same output to the submitted hw. You will get 10% penalty of the max score otherwise.
  - Please, include your student ID in the name of your submiited file(s), so that TAs can easily identify which files are yours.

## Syllabus
This course provides students with basic concepts in software engineering to develop high-quality software economically. The key concepts include software process models, software modeling and design methods, software testing techniques, project management concepts, and software metrics.

Also, in this class, students are expected to experience how to apply LLM (large language model) such as ChatGpt to improve efficiency of various software development tasks like documentation, code development, test code generation, and so on.
